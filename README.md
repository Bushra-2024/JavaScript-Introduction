## JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted programming language commonly used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It's a core technology of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.

**Uses of JavaScript:**
* *Web Development:* Add interactivity to websites (e.g., forms, slideshows, pop-ups).
* *Backend Development:* Use with Node.js to build server-side applications.
* *Mobile and Desktop Apps:* Frameworks like React Native and Electron enable app development.


## History of JavaScript
### **Timeline**

- **1995**: Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 10 days, initially called **Mocha**.
- **1996**: Renamed to **JavaScript** to attract Java developers, though it is unrelated to Java.
      - Microsoft copied JavaScript as **JScript** for Internet Explorer.
- **1997**: **ECMA** standardized JavaScript as **ECMAScript (ES1)**.
- **2009**: **ES5** introduced significant updates.
- **2015**: **ES6** was a major update, modernizing the language.
- **2016â€“Present**: New ECMAScript versions are released annually (e.g., **ES2016**, **ES2017**).

JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting language to a powerful tool for building web applications, servers, and more!

**ECMAScript** is the standard or set of rules for scripting languages like JavaScript.
JavaScript is a programming language that follows the ECMAScript rules, but it also includes extra features for working with websites and web applications.


## Running JavaScript Code in Three Ways

1. Console Tab of Web Browser
2. Using Node.js in Terminal
3. Using Code Runner Extension in VS Code


## JavaScript Variables and Constants
### **Variable (`let`, `var`)**
- Stores data that can be changed.
- `let` newer version , `var` new way of declaring.

### **Constant (`const`)**
- Stores data that cannot be changed after initialization.
- Must be initialized during declaration.

## JavaScript Values:
1. *Primitives:
   Stored directly in memory.
   Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.
   
2. *Objects:
    Stored by reference (not directly in memory).
   Types: Arrays, Functions, Objects.
